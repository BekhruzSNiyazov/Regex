TODO

* add counted repetitions, this will require changes to the lexer (new special chars), to the parser (new node types), the compiler (new instructions) and the matcher (ugh)

* Change Alternation parsing from using the binary_node to the multi_node.  this should decrease parse tree depth for large alternations (e.g. "(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|...)").  also change alternation compilation step to handle this inline versus via recusion.

* Add tests for non greedy operators, at this point they should perform identically to thier greedy cousins.

* Add support for capture sets.(then test non greedy operators properly)

* Add tests for OOM conditions (look into substituting an alternate malloc implementation that faults.

* Add many many more matching tests, look into finding a library of example regexps with positive/negative strings to match
