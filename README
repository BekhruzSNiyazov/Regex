This project was designed to learn more about finite state machines 
and in general good c design.

lots of tests added, playing around with fuzz testings (sending random data to the engine to try to crash it).

rewrote the parser 3-4 times :)
it seems like * and basic character classes are working, some tests are failing
and many more tests need to be written to confirm the operation of the parser.

first major bit of functionality, direct character matching and '.' 
wildcard support.
also an extremely simple testing framework was added along with a 
'make test' target.
